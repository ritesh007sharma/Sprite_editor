# a8-sprite-editor-f19-CloudKingdom

This program is a Sprite Editor where users are allowed to create and edit a sprite. A sprite is created by drawing on one or more frames. These frames can be played one after another to create an animation cycle in order to make the sprite look like it is changing (i.e. walking, jumping, changing colors, etc.). Users are able to save and load their sprite so they may continue their work at a later time. 

Our sprite editor has the following additional features:

Highlighted selected pixel- Highlights what pixel is currently selected in the sprite editor.

DDA use for line drawing- Connected line drawing in order to give a smoother image.

Fill- fills in the surrounding pixels until it hits a different color of pixel.

Erase- Removes the color on a specific pixel.

Custom Color Palette- allows for the user to create a color, select a color from a preselected color palette, and create a custom color palette that contains up to 16 colors.

Flip Horizontal/Vertical- Flips the given frame horizontally/vertically (cool tip is to duplicate the frame 4 times and continually flip horizontal/vertical in order to get the sprite to look like it is rotating in the animated preview.

Scale Pixel Up/Down- Scales the pixel quality up/down by a factor of 2.

Duplicate Frame- Creates a new frame with the same image on it as the previous frame.

Reset Frame- Resets a frame to a blank canvas.

Delete Frame- Deletes a given frame.



This program was created on Ubuntu VM using Qt and should be run on an Ubuntu VM as well.
